## Seeting up your project with few commands

### Installation Guide

Keep in mind, `my-application` name of your project but you can update while cloning this repository
```sh
npx git@github.com:tayyabsaleem7756/igni.git my-application
```

### Install dependencies</br>
First, move into project folder.
```sh
cd my-application

```
npm(node package manager) will automatically install all dependencies
```sh
npm install

```

### Create a new project

`project` refers to your project(name).

```sh
$ npm run 
```

This command will prompt you for your:

- **prodject** name
- **baseUrl** (e.g. www.mytestdomain.com)

The third confirmation is for `testrail configuration` if you want to configure so type y, 
- **Do you want configure testrail?'** (y/N)

### Setup almost Done !
